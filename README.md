# ðŸ’« About Me:

HelloðŸ‘‹! I'm Adel Dsouza, a passionate and driven computer science student at Manipal Institute of Technology, set to graduate in 2026. My journey in technology started early, and I have been honing my skills in various areas of computer science ever since.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy indulging in a range of hobbies. Cooking is a passion of mine, and I love experimenting with new recipes and cuisines. Reading books, which mostly includes fiction, provides me with relaxation and new perspectives. Additionally, I find joy and creativity in dancing, which allows me to express myself and stay active.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of the work I've done, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
