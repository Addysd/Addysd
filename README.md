# 💫 About Me:

Hello👋! Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm Adel Dsouza, a passionate and driven computer science student at Manipal Institute of Technology, set to graduate in 2026. 

I'm thrilled to be part of the GitHub community, where I can connect with fellow developers and collaborate on innovative projects. My passion for computer science drives me to continually explore new technologies, solve complex problems, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of software development.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy indulging in a range of hobbies. Cooking, Reading books, which mostly includes fiction, provides me with relaxation. Additionally, I find joy and creativity in dancing. I also love watching new series and movies, always on the lookout for captivating stories and characters.
